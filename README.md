# Connect4U
Play Connect4 against the Wii U

This was my initial attempt at a Wii U game. My son wanted to have a go at writing a Wii U game. My son followed online tutorials to set up the development kit and get the 'Hello World' program to run on the Wii U. I converted my Java console version of [Connect4](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/Connect4) to C. I helped him get this running as a console game on the Wii U. I then spent some time converting this adding graphics and sound to operate a bit like my windows version. I've written about what I learnt while doing thses games in the [PacMan-ish Wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki).

The Draw.c/Draw.h used include more functionality than is currently used. We hope to do an update to this game to improve the graphics at some stage.
