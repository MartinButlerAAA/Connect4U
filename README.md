# Connect4U
Play Connect4 against the Wii U

My son wanted to have a go at writing a Wii U game, so this is our first project. He followed online tutorials to set up the development kit, and get the 'Hello World' program to run on the Wii U. I converted my Java console version of [Connect4](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/Connect4) to C. I helped him get this running as a console game on the Wii U. We then spent some time improving it, adding graphics and sound. I've written about what I learnt while doing thses games in the [PacMan-ish Wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki).


The Images were drawn with Microsoft Paint and converted to header files using the tool [ProcessBmp](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/ProcessBmp). The sounds have been borrowed from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and coverted to header files using the tool [ProcessWav](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/ProcessWav). Draw.c/Draw.h include more functionality than is currently used. We hope to update this game to improve the graphics.
